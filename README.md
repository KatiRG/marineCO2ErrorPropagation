# Error-space diagram for the marine CO2 system

This is an interactive application that displays the error-space diagram for a selected output variable (e.g. CO3) calculated from an input measurement pair (e.g. pCO2 and DIC). Default values for other input variables (uncertainty in measurement pair, salinity, temperature, pressure and concentrations of phosphorous and silicon) are modifiable with the user interface. 

The calculations are performed using the functions in the R-based ![seacarb](https://github.com/jamesorr/seacarb-git.git) repository.

The application is hosted here:
